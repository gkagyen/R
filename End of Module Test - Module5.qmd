## Day 15: Break Day & Data Storytelling Test

### Take a Break!

Congratulations on completing 15 days of learning R! Take some time to relax and review what youâ€™ve learned.

### **Instructions For Submission**

-   Answer all the questions provided in an R script

-   Save the finished work with your last name and module number separated by an underscore (e.g. if your name is **Benjamin Owusu**, you save the script file as `Owusu_Module5.R` )

-   Submit the saved script to me via email at **`gkagyen@ghana-rusers.org`** with the subject **Module 5 Test**

-   You have one day to complete this test and submit by end of day on **`Wednesday 23rd April 2024`**

### **Data Storytelling Test**

To reinforce your skills, try these tasks using the **`ChickWeight`** dataset:

1.  **Base R Plots**

    a)  Create a scatter plot of weight vs. time for all chicks
    b)  Make a histogram of weights at day 21 only
    c)  Generate a boxplot comparing weights across different diets
    d)  Create a bar chart showing mean weight per diet

2.  **Basic ggplot2**

    a)  Make a scatter plot of weight vs. time with diet-specific colours
    b)  Create a line plot showing average weight over time for each diet
    c)  Generate a histogram of all weights with 15 bins
    d)  Make a boxplot of weights by diet with flipped coordinates

3.  **Customizing ggplot2**

    a)  Add a title "Chick Growth by Diet" and axis labels to any plot from Q2
    b)  Make points larger `(size=3)` and semi-transparent `(alpha=0.6)` in the scatter plot
    c)  Change line type to dashed in the line plot
    d)  Apply the **`theme_classic()`** to one of your plots

4.  **Faceting**

    a)  Create faceted histograms showing weight distributions per diet
    b)  Make a faceted scatter plot (time vs. weight) with one facet per chick
    c)  Add free y-scales to the faceted histograms

5.  **Theme Customization**

    a)  Create a custom theme that:

    -   Has a light blue panel background
    -   Uses bold, dark red axis titles
    -   Removes minor grid line

    b)  Apply this theme to your line plot from Question 2

6.  **Annotations**

    a)  Add a text annotation at day 10, weight 150 saying "Growth Spurt"

    b)  Place a horizontal reference line at the overall mean weight

    c)  Highlight the maximum weight value with a point annotation
