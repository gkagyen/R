## Day 20: Break Day Mini Project

### Take a Break!

Congratulations on completing 20 days of learning R! Take some time to relax and review what youâ€™ve learned.

### Instructions For Submission

-   Answer all the questions provided in an R script

-   Save the finished work with your last name and module number separated by an underscore (e.g. if your name is **Benjamin Owusu**, you save the script file as `Owusu_Module4.R` )

-   Submit the saved script to me via email at **`gkagyen@ghana-rusers.org`** with the subject **Module 5 Test**

-   You have one day to complete this test and submit by end of day on **`Thursday May 1, 2024`**

### **Stats & ML Mini Project** 

This mini project is designed to test your understanding through a realistic healthcare analytics scenario using the **Pima Indians diabetes** dataset `pima` from the `pdp` package.

### Overview

**Objective:** Analyse diabetes risk factors using statistical methods and build a predictive model

**Part 1 Statistical Analysis**

1.  Clean the dataset and perform some EDA on the dataset
2.  Perform Some hypothesis tests
    -   perform a t-test to compare mean glucose- levels between diabetic/non-diabetic groups
    -   conduct a chi-square test between diabetes and hypertension (pressure \> 90)
    -   run a one-way ANOVA comparing BMI across age groups (create age categories)
3.  Create 3 plots using ggplot2 showing
    -   Boxplot of insulin by diabetes status
    -   Bar plot of diabetes prevalence by `age_group`
    -   scatterplot of `glucose` v `mass`

**Part 2 - Machine Learning**

1.  Perform a Linear regression to predict bmi (`mass`) using:
    -   `glucose` and `insulin` only
    -   `glucose`, `pressure` and `age`
    -   make predictions with the two models and compare their evaluation metrics (R-squared, MAE and RMSE)
2.  Build a diabetes classifier (logistic regression model) using:
    -   `glucose` and `insuling` only
    -   predictors from the regression models that were significant
    -   make predictions on the test data and evaluate performance using a confusion matrix

### Deliverables

1.  R script with all codes
2.  A pdf report containing:
    -   key statistical findings
    -   model performance summaries
    -   visualisations and interpretations
